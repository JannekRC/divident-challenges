<p align="center">This second GitHub helped us to learn more about git branches and reviews. It was succcessful for both of us. We managed to delete branches locally & remotely via CLI and User Interface also. We created some reviews and repository protection, and did some pull requests to understand situations. Either, we checked out what does it mean git merge --no-ff and we have some questions about it. :D<p>
